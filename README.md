#### **Overview**

** **

[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) was the worlds first website and among the worlds least visited. The idea behind this webpage is to show how far web design has come since its creation and to pay homage to those who started it all.

** **

#### **UX**

** **

For a product we use every day I find there is a remarkable lack of knowledge about the history and foundation of how the world wide web started. This webpage seeks to educate people on wwws history and to highlight the people who created it.

**1. Strategy**

To ensure the UX is simple and user-friendly, by providing easy navigation through all pages on the site.

**Project Goals:**

*   To highlight the progression of web design and internet applications since the developmest of the first website.
*   To showcase the people behind the first website.
*   To provide a brief history of the developement of the world wide web.

**Customer Goals:**

*   Providing an easier to navigate more visaully pleasing site.
*   Minimizing the risk of information overload, by condensing the text into a more readable layout
*   To present photos of the people who were behind the development to give it a more human element.

**2. Scope**

*   To create a fluid layout for ease of use.
*   Fine-tuning and implementing my skills.

**3. Structure**

I designed this page to create a more up to date and eye-catching webpage based on the world's first webpage. The original page is just text-based with no styling. My version utilizes modern internet protocols to create a more aesthetically pleasing visual.

**4. Skeleton**

*   Wireframes: See page 4
*   Fixed navigation bar -  5-page links & brand either side
*   Home, People, History, FAQ and Original
*   Footer with contact info, the original page & social media links

**5. Surface**

**Images**

The core of the webpage is the global connectivity image in the background.

**Colours**

The background picture is the basis for the overall colour scheme. 

**Typography**

*   "Anton" font (san serif as backup) for header and footer
*   "Titillium" font (san serif as backup) for all section content.

**User Stories**

“When was the internet developed and how did it come to be?”

“I have always wondered who was behind the development of the internet”

“This sites (CERN)layout and design is quite off-putting”

#### **Wireframes**

#### **Features**

** **

**Existing Features**

*   Designed with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
*   3 separate HTML pages.
*   Fixed navigation bar.
*   Introduction section animation.

**Features Left to Implement when skills develop**

*   Add more pages so that all information from the original site will be displayed.
*   Adding more animations and transitions for a more visually pleasing site.
*   To make use of the unused visual real-estate on a bigger screen, I will add more JS connectivity and network visuals at a later date.

#### **Project barriers and the solutions**

** **

*   Initially, the transition from following an instructional video to creating your own code was challenging but eventually overcome through perseverence and assistance from the slack community.
*   I started this project with a desktop-first approach and as the project went on I certainly realised the benefits of a mobile-first approach.

** **

#### **Deployment**

** **

**GitHub**

*   Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
*   Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

**Local**

*   You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
*   The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
*   The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
*   User needs to open the unzipped folder and open index.html for the homepage to populate.
