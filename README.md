#### **Overview**

** **

[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) was the worlds first website and among the worlds least visited. The idea behind this webpage is to show how far web design has come since its creation and to pay homage to those who started it all.

** **

#### **UX**

** **

For a product we use every day I find there is a remarkable lack of knowledge about the history and foundation of how the world wide web started. This webpage is a stepping stone into not only educating people on its history but highlighting the people who created it.

**1. Strategy**

The UX is simple and user-friendly to provide easy navigation through all pages on the site.

**Project Goals:**

*   Highlighting the progression of web design and internet applications since the developmest of the first website.
*   Showcasing the people behind the first website.
*   Providing a brief history of how it all came to be.

**Customer Goals:**

*   Providing a more pleasing and easier to navigate the site.
*   The original site had quite a lot of information overload, one of the main focuses was to condense the text into a more readable layout
*   Presenting photos of the people who were behind the development to give it a more human element.

**2. Scope**

*   Creating a fluid layout for ease of use.
*   Implementing and fine-tuning my skills.

**3. Structure**

I designed this page to create a more up to date and eye-catching webpage based on the world's first page. The original page is just text-based with no styling, my version takes modern internet protocols to allow for much more aesthetically pleasing visuals.

**4. Skeleton**

*   Wireframes: See page 4
*   Fixed navigation bar -  5-page links & brand either side
*   Home, People, History, FAQ and Original
*   Footer with contact info, the original page & social media

**5. Surface**

**Images**

The core of the webpage is the global connectivity image in the background.

**Colours**

The background picture is the basis for the overall colour scheme. 

**Typography**

*   "Anton" font (san serif as backup) for header and footer
*   "Titillium" font (san serif as backup) for all section content.

**Images**

The image selection has been carefully considered to best showcase each reserve.

**User Stories**

“I have always wondered who was behind the development of the internet”

“When was the internet developed and how did it come to be?”

“This site (CERN) is not easy to digest”

“The original sites layout and design is quite off-putting”

“When was the internet developed and how did it come to be?”

#### **Features**

** **

**Existing Features**

*   Designed with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
*   3 separate HTML pages.
*   Fixed navigation bar.
*   Introduction section animation.

**Features Left to Implement when skills develop**

*   Add more pages so that all information from the original site will be displayed.
*   Adding more animations and transitions for a more visually pleasing site.
*   There is a lot of unused visual real-estate on a bigger screen, I would like to add more js connectivity and network visuals at a later date.

#### **Project barriers and the solutions**

** **

*   Initially, the transition from following an instructional video to creating your code was challenging but eventually that knowledge came to the forefront rather than having to refer back.
*   I started this project with a desktop-first approach and as the project went on I certainly realised the benefits of a mobile-first approach.

** **

#### **Deployment**

** **

**GitHub**

*   Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
*   Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

**Local**

*   You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
*   The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
*   The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine.
*   User needs to open the unzipped folder and open index.html for the homepage to populate.
