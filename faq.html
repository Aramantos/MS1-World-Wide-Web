                browsing from the WWW project page, as everything should be arranged logically. Here though are things which maybe 
                didn't fit into the structure, with pointers to the answers which maybe did. It’s an experiment, started May 92.

                            This is what people seem to call this problem in general.
                            As a physical server can serve many different types of information from different servers, 
                            we talk about finding documents and indexes, as that is what the user sees. To the reader, 
                            the web is a continuum. When a new server appears, it may serve many databases of data from 
                            different sources and on different subjects. The new data must be incorporated into the web. 
                            This means putting links to data on the new server (especially to a general overview document 
                            for the server if there is one) from existing documents which interested readers might be reading, 
                            or putting it into an index which people might search.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            The person publishing the data must go through the same process as the person searching for it. 
                            When (s)he has found an overview page which (s)he feels ought to refer to the new data, (s)he can 
                            ask the author of that document (who ought to have signed it with a link to his or her mail address) 
                            to put in a link. There may be several links from different documents: there is not one master list. 
                            Of course, some servers are put up for internal use only, and links are only made from local documents. 
                            I only find out about these servers by word of mouth, but they exist.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            Currently, there are three parallel trees on the web for finding data starting from scratch. 
                            The most interesting one is classified by subject. I've got an "Other subjects" link from Cern's 
                            home page to a master page of information by subject. From that, I have links to individual servers 
                            of all kinds (W3, WAIS and Gopher), and in cases where there are a lot like physics and biology, 
                            a link to a page about one specific subject. In this way, you can browse the web by subject like a library. 
                            I am looking for people in other disciplines to take over the subtrees for those disciplines as the 
                            load gets heavier (I may have candidates for some). The tree tends to be ought of date, and its authors 
                            rely on feedback to put in things which are missing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            The other trees are by organisation and by server type. The list by server type is easy because the 
                            people responsible for each protocol keep a list of the servers using it. That is, there is a tree of 
                            gophers, and there is an index of WAIS indexes. There is the W3/WAIS/Archie server for FTP sites. 
                            This tree isn't so useful unless you know what sort of a server you are looking for, but it tends 
                            to be more up-to-date than the subject index. It also has things in which aren't just about subjects. 
                            The third tree was going to be a geographic tree of organisations, but that isn't at all up-to-date.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            By the way, it would be easy in principle for a third party to run over these trees and make indexes of 
                            what they find. It is just that no one has done it as far as I know because there isn't yet an indexer 
                            which runs over the web directly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            As you can see, the web is sufficiently flexible to allow several ways of finding information. 
                            In the end, I think a typical resource discovery session will involve someone starting on their 
                            "home" document, following one to two links to an index, then searching, and following several 
                            links from what they have found. In some cases, there will be more than one index search involved, 
                            such as at first for an organisation, and having found that, a search within it for a person or document. 
                            We need to keep this flexibility, as the available information in different places has such different 
                            characteristics.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            In the long term, when there is a really large mass of data out there, with deep interconnections, 
                            then there is some really exciting work to be done on automatic algorithms to make multi-level searches.

                            W3 is comparable to both WAIS and Gopher, in that it is a client-server information system running 
                            over the internet. There is a difference in the data models. The W3 model is that everything (document, 
                            menu, index etc) is represented to the user as a hypertext (hypermedia) object. There are two navigation 
                            operations are available to the user: to follow a link or to send a query to a server. Only certain 
                            documents are flagged as having a search facility, and not all documents have links, but some documents 
                            have both. That's a pretty simple model and results in a pretty simple user interface.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            Two neat things fall out of this model. One is that it turns out that almost all other information 
                            systems can be represented in terms of W3 documents. A W3 user can interrogate WAIS indexes (example) 
                            and Gopher servers (example). This comes from the flexibility of the W3 model to describe other structures. 
                            A WAIS database is a searchable document. The hit-list returned by a WAIS server (or any other query engine) 
                            is a hypertext document with links to the documents found. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            Gopher menus (or any other hierarchical menu system, including a file system) are represented as lists of 
                            items linked to other objects. The W3 system has an open addressing scheme allowing links to be made to 
                            any objects on W3, WAIS, Gopher, FTP, NFS, or Network News servers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="faq-para">
                            This flexibility has allowed lots of different kinds of data to be put on-line by writing a simple script 
                            to generate a hypertext "view" of the database. The hypertext model, then, is flexible. It is also as 
                            powerful as a communications medium. To author a document in hypertext is to communicate better. It 
                            allows one to put in a link whenever the reader might need background information.

                            You miss the links in WAIS in two ways. One is when you are looking for an index. You can't follow 
                            links from an overview page to "browse" through different indexes. You can only use a master index 
                            (the directory of sources) to find indexes. The other way is that when you have retrieved something, 
                            whether part of the FORTRAN manual or part of a mail discussion, you get it in isolation. You can't 
                            follow links from that document to related documents.

                            A Gopher menu is a dry list of items. Each line has 80 characters in which to describe an option. 
                            In practice, to communicate with the reader, one needs the full power of text formatting in many styles. 
                            A plain list turns out to be relatively infrequently used when the author or the program generating the

                            only a small step toward the flexible blending of links and text which is hypertext.

                            The second big difference is that W3 is designed to include collaborative authoring (CSCW) so that 
                            groups can share information, rather than simply individuals disseminate it. We only have a stab at 
                            this on the NeXT platform, as we were overtaken by the web's success in dissemination mode.

                            The W3 software is not (May 92) as deeply deployed as WAIS and Gopher software. This is basically 
                            because it takes more time to write a hypertext client than a menu or query client. (Also, because 
                            the initial W3 instigators are paid to work for the world of High-Energy Physics primarily).

                            However, the W3 world is growing very fast. There is widespread recognition that hypertext is 
                            essential for the next generation. It is planned to merge the W3 and Gopher systems, and there is 
                            no reason (apart from server simplicity and, perhaps, response time) why both of these systems could 
                            not use the WAIS protocol when it settles down.

                            Since this FAQ came up, a lot more documentation about starting servers has come onto the web, 
                            so it might pay you to browse a bit more. There are so many ways, that it might seem complicated, 
                            but in fact, most of the methods are very easy.

                            The server that we distribute as WWWDaemon is in two parts: a common HTDaemon program taking care of 
                            the communications, and a variable HTRetrieve function called by HTDaemon with the significant part 
                            of the address (i.e. after host) split as argument and keywords (look at the code).

                            The default HTRetrieve function, located in HTRetrieve.c, only knows about finding files and sending them. 
                            To make an index server, you need an HTRetrieve that knows how to query a database or otherwise find info, 
                            from keywords supplied after the '?' in the address. It can be as simple as a 'grep' in a series of files.
